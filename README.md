## My process

So, i usually breakdown the mockup ui into components and then start to make changes to them one by one.
The first was the navbar and by far wich took the longest to make, lmao. It has two sections, the site icon and the links, i grouped the links thogeter so it would be easier to style in the responsive version. Made some cute little buttons too.
The last but not the least was the main content, that i tried to avoid using grid and venture across flexbox.. it was a challange. Getting the hero image not to outsize and overflow took some time, but i finally could divide the main content between CTA and Hero.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Some little animation
- sidebar dropdown

### What I learned

I learned a couple of things here:

- How to style a nice and responsive navbar.
- Using css fitlers to make a nice and colorful detail.
- Acessiblity issues regarding some bad pratices in responsive's layouts
